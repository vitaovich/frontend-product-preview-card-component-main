## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styles
- [Azure Static Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/static) - For deployment and hosting

### What I learned

Tailwind CSS was great for quickly designing this website.

### Continued development

I plan to continue focusing on how to layout components properly in order for positions and spacing of elements. Also, will start looking into using more features of React and NextJS to build more interactive components. Even make a few backend calls eventually.

### Useful resources
